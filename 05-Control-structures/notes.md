# Control structures

## Run Code conditionally: the if Construct

The if construct

```php
if (condition) {
  // code to run if condition is true
}
```

```php
if (true) {
  echo "The condition is true";
}

if (false) {
  echo "The condition is false";
}
```

The if else construct

```php
if (condition) {
  // code to run if condition is true
} else {
  // code to run if condition is false
}
```

## Compare One Value to another: Comparison Operators

Comparison Operators

| Operator | Name                     | Example  |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| ==       | equal                    | $a == $b |
| !=       | not equal                | $a != $b |
| <        | less than                | $a < $b  |
| >        | greater than             | $a > $b  |
| <=       | less than or equal to    | $a <= $b |
| >=       | greater than or equal to | $a >= $b |
